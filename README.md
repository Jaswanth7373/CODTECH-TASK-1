Overview:

Deep Learning: A subfield of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (deep structures) to model complex patterns.

Image Recognition: The task of identifying objects or patterns within images.
Objectives:

Classification: Assigning a label (class) to an input image.

Object Detection: Locating and identifying specific instances of objects within an image.
Semantic Segmentation: Assigning a class label to each pixel in an image.

Key Activities:

Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Gather labeled images for training.

Resize, normalize, and augment data.

Model Architecture Design:

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used.

Custom architectures or transfer learning from pre-trained models.
